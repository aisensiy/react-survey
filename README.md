# React Survey

Many tutorials cover basics of React and Redux, but they aren't helpful in handling a real world project such as survey or questionnaire. React Survey project shows how to build a more complex web application with React and Redux. 

See live demo [here](https://aisensiy.github.io/react-survey)

## Recently Update

Recently I don't have enough time to give frequent update for this project. But it seems there is still someone wanna fork and learn this project. I really appreciate your supports. I will do my best to continue update this project. Here is some plan for this project.

1. Update deprecated codes in react
2. Update bugs in issue
3. Give a easier way to make the backend work with frontend

PR is welcome :)

## Run

The demo only shows a front end of the application. For a fully functioning application, the back end part is also necessary.

### Installing Front End

```sh
npm install
export REACT_APP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000
npm start
```

### Installing Back End

Get the back end part from [here](https://github.com/aisensiy/rails-survey-backend). This is a Rails 5 application. You need to install Ruby on your machine. 

The fastest way to deploy the back end is to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
